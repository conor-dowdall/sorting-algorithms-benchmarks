## A Java-Based Application to Benchmark Several Sorting Algorithms

For this project, I wrote an application to benchmark the time-based performance of five sorting algorithms:

1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Quicksort
5. Counting Sort

A report accompanies this project, which introduces the concept of sorting in computer science, discusses the algorithms, and presents the benchmarking results.
